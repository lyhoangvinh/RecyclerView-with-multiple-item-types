# RecyclerView with multiple item types

RecyclerView with heterogeneous layouts is commonly used in to display section headers and details(Both require different layouts, hence different view type).
Also, itâ€™s used in a Newsfeed Application(like Facebook, Instagram) that display essentially different views for different types.
Example: text, image, gif, video etc. Each of these requires a different layout type inside the RecyclerView.
